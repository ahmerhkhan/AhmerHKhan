# Hey, I'm Ahmer Habib Khan

**Product-Focused Builder · Early-Stage Fintech Founder · AI-Assisted Prototyper**

I build early-stage products by turning ambiguous business problems into testable, working MVPs. My strength sits at the intersection of product thinking and lightweight technical execution — user research, scoping MVPs, and shipping functional demos using modern web stacks and AI-assisted workflows.

I operate closer to product: defining what to build, validating why it matters, and using AI tools and modern frameworks to move from idea → prototype → iteration quickly.
