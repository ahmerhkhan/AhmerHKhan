# Hey, I'm Ahmer Habib Khan

**Product-Focused Builder** | **AI-Native Engineer** | **Fintech Founder**

I turn complex business judgment into functional software. I specialize in AI-native development (Vibecoding)—leveraging LLMs and modern frameworks to move from concept to production at a speed traditional workflows can't match. Experienced in architecting full-stack applications from concept to deployment, with expertise in fintech infrastructure and B2B SaaS.
